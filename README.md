Qiskit Global Summer School is a two-week intensive summer school designed to empower the next generation of quantum developers with the knowledge to explore quantum applications on their own. The curriculum covers quantum computing preliminaries before focusing on two key areas: superconducting devices and quantum chemistry applications.


This is the final project for the Qiskit lab.
Detailed instructions is provided in the jupyter notebook.

PROJECT PLAN

###################################

AIM: To implement a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm that simulates the ground state energy of the Lithium Hydride (LiH) molecule. 

This project contains documentation on all the following steps undertaken during the simulation:
1. Install qiskit sdk 
2. Importing of all the necessary packages 
3. Define our noise model based on the ibmq_essex chip 
4. Defining necessary optimizers 
5. Defining the molecule 
6. Classically solve for the lowest eigenvalue 
7. Choosing the components to make the VQE algorithm 
8. Compare the convergence of different choices for building your VQE algorithm 
9. Compute the ground state energy of LiH at various different interatomic distances 
10.Create full graph for all 
11.Compare the results with the ideal case
